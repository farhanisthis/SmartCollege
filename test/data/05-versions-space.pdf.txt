CHAPTER 3: SYSTEM DESIGN 
3.1 Database Design: 
This section presents the database schema design for the Smart College Attendance Management 
System (AMS) using MongoDB as the database and Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling 
(ODM) library. The database is designed to ensure scalability, data consistency, and efficient 
relationships between different entities. The system consists of four primary collections: Users, 
Subjects, Timetables, and Attendance Records. 
 The User schema manages authentication details, user roles, and profile information for 
administrators, teachers, and students. 
 The Subject schema stores academic subject information, including codes, names, and 
classifications. 
 The Timetable schema manages class schedules, assigned teachers, and subject details. 
 The Attendance schema links users and timetables by maintaining records of attendance 
with statuses such as present, absent, or late. 
Each schema has been structured with appropriate data types, validation rules, and relationships 
to ensure seamless interaction between various system components. 
 
3.1.1 User Schema: 
The User schema stores and manages information about all registered users in the system. It 
includes details such as name, email, encrypted password, role (admin, teacher, or student), and 
additional academic information (enrollment, batch, section, year for students; assigned 
sections/subjects for teachers). This schema ensures proper authentication, role-based access 
control, and efficient user management. 
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema( 
  { 
    name: { type: String, required: true, trim: true }, 
    email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true, lowercase: true }, 
    passwordHash: { type: String, required: true }, 
    role: { type: String, enum: ["admin", "teacher", "student"], required: true }, 
    // Student-specific fields 
    enrollment: { type: String, unique: true, sparse: true }, 
    batch: { type: String }, 
    section: { type: String }, 
    year: { type: Number }, 
    // Teacher-specific fields 
    subjects: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Subject" }], 
    sections: [{ type: String }], 
    mentorOf: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" }], 
    isActive: { type: Boolean, default: true }, 
  }, 
  { timestamps: true } 
); 
 

26 
 
3.1.2 Subject Schema: 
The Subject schema defines and organizes subject-related data, including subject name, code, 
year, semester, credits, and category (core, elective, lab, etc.). This schema ensures academic 
subjects are structured properly and linked to both timetables and attendance records. 
const subjectSchema = new mongoose.Schema( 
  { 
    name: { type: String, required: true, trim: true }, 
    code: { type: String, required: true, unique: true, uppercase: true }, 
    description: { type: String }, 
    year: { type: Number, required: true }, 
    semester: { type: Number, required: true }, 
    credits: { type: Number, default: 3 }, 
    category: { type: String, enum: ["core", "elective", "lab", "project"], required: true }, 
    department: { type: String }, 
    isActive: { type: Boolean, default: true }, 
  }, 
  { timestamps: true } 
); 
 
3.1.3 Timetable Schema: 
The Timetable schema stores details of academic schedules including assigned teacher, subject, 
class batch, section, and time slots. It helps in managing conflicts, teacher availability, and 
classroom allocation. 
const timetableSchema = new mongoose.Schema( 
  { 
    subject: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Subject", required: true }, 
    teacher: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User", required: true }, 
    batch: { type: String, required: true }, 
    section: { type: String, required: true }, 
    // Schedule details 
    dayOfWeek: { type: String, enum: ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", 
"Saturday"], required: true }, 
    startTime: { type: String, required: true }, // HH:mm format 
    endTime: { type: String, required: true }, 
    duration: { type: Number }, // in minutes 
 
    slotType: { type: String, enum: ["theory", "lab", "tutorial", "practical"], required: true }, 
    room: { type: String }, 
    semester: { type: Number }, 
    academicYear: { type: String }, 
 
    isActive: { type: Boolean, default: true }, 
  }, 
  { timestamps: true } 
); 
 

27 
 
3.1.4 Attendance Schema: 
The Attendance schema is central to the system and maintains records of daily attendance for 
each student. It links a specific timetable entry with a date and tracks the attendance status 
(present, absent, late) of all students in that class. 
const attendanceSchema = new mongoose.Schema( 
  { 
    date: { type: Date, required: true }, 
    timetableId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Timetable", required: true }, 
    subject: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Subject", required: true }, 
    teacher: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User", required: true }, 
    batch: { type: String, required: true }, 
    section: { type: String, required: true }, 
    studentRecords: [ 
      { 
        student: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User", required: true }, 
        status: { type: String, enum: ["present", "absent", "late"], required: true }, 
        remarks: { type: String }, 
        markedAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }, 
      }, 
    ], 
    totalStudents: { type: Number }, 
    presentCount: { type: Number }, 
    absentCount: { type: Number }, 
    attendancePercentage: { type: Number }, 
  }, 
  { timestamps: true });

5.3 Limitations & Future Scope: 
 
Limitations: 
Although the Smart College Attendance Management System (AMS) is a robust and efficient 
solution for managing institutional attendance and timetables, the current version has some 
limitations that can be addressed in future enhancements: 
 
1. Dependence on Internet Connectivity: 
The system is web-based and requires a stable internet connection to operate. In case of 
poor connectivity, teachers and students may face difficulties in accessing attendance 
records or updating information. 
 
2. Absence of Biometric/Facial Recognition: 
Attendance is marked manually by teachers through the digital interface. Automated 
systems such as biometric devices or AI-based facial recognition are not integrated in the 
current phase. 
 
3. Basic Notification System: 
The current version only provides basic reporting and dashboards. Automated SMS/email 
alerts for low attendance or schedule changes are planned but not yet fully functional. 
 
4. Single Language Limitation: 
The platform currently supports English as the only language. Institutions in multi-lingual 
regions may face accessibility issues for students and faculty who prefer local languages. 
5. Manual Administrative Setup: 
Initial configuration, such as adding students, teachers, subjects, and timetables, has to be 
done manually by the administrator. Bulk automation is limited and may require 
additional effort for large institutions. 
 
6. Limited Mobile Support: 
Although the system is mobile-responsive, there is no dedicated Android/iOS application 
yet, which may reduce convenience for users who prefer app-based access. 
 
Future Scope:

automatic synchronization once internet connectivity is restored. 
 
2. AI & Biometric Integration: 
o Facial Recognition: AI-based attendance marking using cameras to automatically 
detect and record students. 
o Biometric Devices: Fingerprint or RFID-based attendance systems integrated 
directly into the platform for accuracy and security. 
 
3. Mobile Application Development: 
Dedicated Android and iOS apps using React Native or Flutter for improved 
accessibility, push notifications, and offline features. 
 
4. Advanced Reporting & Predictive Analytics: 
o Predict attendance shortages or irregularity trends using machine learning. 
o Generate insights for teachers and management to identify at-risk students early. 
o Provide graphical analytics for better decision-making. 
 
5. Integration with LMS & ERP Systems: 
o Link attendance data with Learning Management Systems (LMS) for better 
academic tracking. 
o Integration with ERP systems for centralized control over academics, fees, and 
administration. 
 
6. Multi-Language Support: 
Adding regional and international languages to increase adoption across diverse 
institutions globally. 
 
7. Automated Communication System: 
o Real-time SMS/email alerts to students and parents regarding attendance, 
timetable changes, or announcements. 
o Push notifications for mobile apps to enhance communication efficiency. 
 
8. Blockchain for Data Security:
